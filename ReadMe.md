#Executor-demo
This is a simple Spring boot application that runs a collection of threads 
on a ThreadPoolTaskExecutor. The executor can be fully configured with the 
application.properties file.

The application builds to a Spring Boot executable jar using Maven.

To build the app

```mvn package```

To run the app

```java -jar target/executor-demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar```

This is really a simple app wit few dependencies (beyond the world of spring boot).

Enjoy.
